Hello world!

I'll add more info about me later, just wanted to put this up to remind myself it's a thing I can do.

I sporadically post updates on [my blog][blog].

## Zsh

I've written plenty of Zsh plugins, especially ones which extend Zsh's Vi Mode.
Those can be found at the organization [@zsh-vi-more][zvm].
